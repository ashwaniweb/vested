                  Signing up for Vested was well worth the effort. Once I
                  completed my profile it was sent to an employer who had an
                  opening they hadnâ€™t posted. The job was mine before anyone
                  other candidate knew it existed
                </p>
                <h5>Nicola M, Controller</h5>

            </Col>
          </Row>
          <Row>
            <Col xs={12} md={8} mdPush={4}>
              <div className="box">
                <img
                  src="/images/professionals/testimonial2.jpg"
                  alt="Duane, Accountant"

                <p>
                  Advancing my career through Vested was easy and fast. Past
                  attempts required much more time and effort, however, with
                  Vested I was being contacted for jobs within a week. Vested
                  highlighted my skills and allowed me to stand out to potential
                  employers. I would 10/10 recommend this website to other
                  professionals
